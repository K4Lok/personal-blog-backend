Here's the repo for the backend of my personal blog, mainly to practice `node.js` and the framework `express.js` that I've learned in this recent. The backend are able to interact with the database which for the purpose of manipulating (create, update, delete) all the blogs info. More details like authentication, input caching for page refresh, markdown content to HTML elements, error handlie, and more will be taken care of. 

> The backend supposed to be accessed only by me, for creating, editing or deleting the blogs. Will try to build a frontend blog website after the things here are all set which are accessible for the public.
